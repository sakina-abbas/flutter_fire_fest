  i feel dew cling to my feet
  and the earth sighs as i am
  immersed in roral petrichor.

  the iridescent sunlight bounces
  across the petals of fleurs prairie,
      and soon i am at a creek,
  in complete solitude.

  as i sit by the water, i ponder this:
  i have learned from the welsh that
  hiraeth means to be homesick
  for a home you cannot return to,
  or that never was.

  i do not think that the welsh
  meant for me to believe
  that my hiraeth is for you.''',

I don't understand what I'm seeing.
There is Stardust in my eyes.
It's fogged up my sight.
I see how everyone is the same.
With their Ugg boots, North Face Jackets,
iPhones, and Coach bags.

Just take off your empty frames and,
Get Stardust in your eyes.
See things through a vivid light.
Get Stardust in your eyes,
Be yourself and don't conform.
Get Stardust in your eyes,
And let your colors shine.''',
